# SeriesInfo

Seriesinfo is a web application that shows information about series and movies.

To do this, it uses the Themoviedb API, from which it obtains the following information:

List of movies.
List of series.
Summary.
Score of the movie or serie.
Actors.
Movies and series in which the actors have worked.
Actor popularity.
Personal information about them. 
Personalized lists of users.

The application can be used without registering. However, only registered users will be able to create custom lists.

In order to register in the application, it is necessary to do it previously on the page www.themoviedb.org, thus obtaining the v3 auth key and the v4 auth read access token, that correspond in the seriesInfo web application with the API Key and the Request Token respectively.
